Hey!

I had a think about a gameplay today, something that would include "uno mas" and even the donuts boxes when there's a bad comit on GitHub.

Here again please let me know if you like it, if you want to change/add/remove anything, and if you think it's doable within the timeframe.

Those are notes so it might not be super accurate. Let me know if it's unclear.

Items
Pint blond = 10pts
Pint dark = 10pts
Red wine = 15pts
White wine = 15pts
Prosecco = 20pts
Champagne (bottle) = 50pts

Cheese (blue) = 10pts
Cheese (white) = 10pts
Meat (ham) = 15pts
Meat (saucisson) =15pts
Fries = 20pts
Burger = 50pts

Specials
"uno mas" = double your drinking points (but very hard to catch)
"Donuts for bad comit on GitHub" = double your food points

Goal = highest score possible
How to reach it?
By having a fair balance between drink and food intake.
If too much drink or food -> lag in control so more difficult to catch the items
Game over after X missed items.

Specials are hidden behind team mates faces = you don't know in advance what it's gonna be so it's a risk


Let's have a chat about it tomorrow so we can decide the type of game and game play.
This way you can start having a look at the changes you'll have to make to the current game (if any) and I'll start listing the assets I need to create.
I'll also sketch some quick wireframes so we have a clear idea of the steps and sequences of screens.
I'm no visual designer but I'll try my best to make something fun!
